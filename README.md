# HeadHunter_CRUD_Api

This C# .NET 6.0 project implements CRUD api for Headhunters and Candidates interaction.

Allowed actions:
  Candidate:
    Create, Update, Delete
  Candidate's skillset:
    Create, Delete
  Company:
    Create, Update, Delete
  Open company's positions:
    Create, Update, Delete

To successfully run the projects it requires to have database engine running.
I was using MSSQL Express - connection string example can be found at DataModels/context.cs (line 22).
